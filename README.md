# Constructor-Word-Guess

Constructor-Word-Guess is a Hangman game based on the names of cities around the world. Simply download the files, install the NPM Inquirer, run "node index," and the game will give you a city name to guess.

# How to play

On start up, the game randomly displays the game board of spaces in the name of the city. You have 10 tries to guess the city name. The game asks you to type a letter then hit 'enter' to see if it is in the word (hint: look first for vowels). 

# Observations

This hangman game was a real challenge. I spent a lot of time getting the functionality to work, and was not able to add as many features as I wanted (validation, duplicate letters, etc). I had a lot of trouble moving data around amongst the three separate js files required for the app. Neverthtess, I enjoyed putting it together (especially when I made it work!). 

This homework allowed me to work with a number of new items, including:
- Constructors 
- Multiple javascript files
- Additional features in inquirer
